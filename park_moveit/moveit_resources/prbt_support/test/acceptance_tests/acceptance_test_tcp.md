# Acceptance Test TCP

## Prerequisites

## Test Sequence:
  1. Open the model in rviz `roslaunch prbt_support test_urdf.launch`.
  2. In Rviz display the tf-frames (Add->rviz->tf).
  3. Close everything.
  4. prbt_support/urdf/prbt.xacro

     Edit the lines
     ```
     <xacro:arg name="tcp_offset_xyz" default="0 0 0.2"/>
     <xacro:arg name="tcp_offset_rpy" default="0 0 0"/>
     ```
     to some desired offset
  5. Open again like before.

## Expected Results:
  1. Everything opens with no errors.
  2. You see a tf-frame named: "[robotname]_tcp".
  3. -
  4. -
  5. Check that the tcp frame now has the desired offset from its preceiding frame.
